============================== Release Notes: v0.1 ==============================

Initial release of the DiHydrogen Distributed Tensor Library.

DiHydrogen is the second version of the Hydrogen fork of the
well-known distributed linear algebra library, Elemental. DiHydrogen
aims to be a basic distributed multilinear algebra interface with a
particular emphasis on the needs of the distributed machine learning
effort, LBANN.

API:

Performance optimizations:

Internal features:
 - Support for the DistConv legacy library
 - Added multi-dimensional tensor class
 - Added support for older CUDA architectures v3.0+
 - Use CUB for memory management
 - Support for point-to-point (P2P) library
 - Support for NVSHMEM halo exchange

DistConv Legacy:
 - batchnorm
 - channel-wise softmax
 - concat
 - convolution
 - deconv
 - leaky-relu
 - pooling
 - relu
 - slice
 - softmax

Build system:
